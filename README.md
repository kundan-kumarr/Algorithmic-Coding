## Data Structure and Algorithms Preparation Guide

#### #100DaysOfCode
-------------------------------------------

#### General Approach 
- Coding 
    - Code should be clean & structured.
    - Cover the edge and base cases.
    - All variables and functions well-defined
- Data Structures & Algorithms 
    - Solve the problem efficiently with suitable data structure or  algorithm.
    - Analyze that solution in terms of time & space complexity and the trade-offs.
    - Compare brute force solutions versus more optimal solutions.
    - Solve Efficiently 
- Communication 
    - Communicate effectively.
